# Text-to-SQL App

This is App which converts natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieves data from a database. Users can upload their own SQLite database or use a sample database.

## Features
- Convert English questions into SQL queries using an LLM.
- Upload your own database or use a sample database.
- Choose from multiple LLM models for query generation.
- View query results and download them as a CSV file.

## Use Cases
Non-Technical Users: Query databases without writing SQL.

Data Analysts: Quickly explore and analyze data using natural language.

Developers: Test and debug SQL queries generated by LLMs.

Educators: Teach SQL concepts by demonstrating how natural language translates to SQL.

## How It Works
1] Database Input:

Users upload their own SQLite database or use the sample database.

Alternatively, users can provide a database URL.

2] Model Selection:

Users choose an LLM model for query generation.

3] Natural Language Query:

Users enter a question in English (e.g., "Show all students in the Data Science course").

4] Generated SQL Query:

The app generates the corresponding SQL query using the selected LLM.

5] Query Execution:

The app executes the SQL query and retrieves the results from the database.

6] Results Display:

The query results are displayed in a table, and users can download them as a CSV file.
